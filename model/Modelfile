LICENSE "NVIDIA AI Foundation Models Community License Agreement
IMPORTANT NOTICE – PLEASE READ AND AGREE BEFORE USING THE NVIDIA AI FOUNDATION MODELS.
This license agreement (“Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you, whether an individual or entity (“you”)
and NVIDIA Corporation (“NVIDIA”) and governs the use of the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models, consisting of large
language models including software, checkpoints, learnt weights, algorithms, parameters, configuration files,
datasets and documentation, if and when available (collectively, “NVIDIA AI Foundation Models”).
This Agreement can be accepted only by an adult of legal age of majority in the country in which the NVIDIA AI
Foundation Models are used.
If you don’t have the required age or authority to accept this Agreement, or if you don’t accept all the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, do not use the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models.
1. License Grant. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA grants you a non-exclusive, revocable, nontransferable, non-sublicensable (except as expressly granted in this Agreement), license to:
1.1 (a) install and use copies of the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models, (b) create Derivative Models(as defined below),
and (c) distribute the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models or Derivative Models in each case with a copy of this
Agreement, all the foregoing for non-production uses, including test and evaluation uses; and
1.2 (a) install and use copies of the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models, (b) create Derivative Models (as defined below),
and (c) distribute the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models or Derivative Models in each case with a copy of this
Agreement, all the foregoing in production uses with a paid subscription to NVIDIA NeMo Framework available
through NVIDIA AI Enterprise. Contact NVIDIA sales for NVIDIA AI Enterprise (see https://www.nvidia.com/enus/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/).
“Derivative Models” mean all derivatives, adaptations, extensions or enhancements to the NVIDIA AI Foundation
Models, works based on the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models, or any other model which is created or initialized by
transfer of patterns of the weights, parameters, activations or output of the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models, to the
other model, in order to cause the other model to perform similarly to the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models, including
- but not limited to - distillation methods entailing the use of intermediate data representations or methods based
on the generation of synthetic data by the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models for training the other model.
2. Use and Distribution. The following terms apply to the use or distribution of the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models
and Derivative Models you develop as authorized in Section 1, and you are responsible for the consequences of
non-conformance with these terms:
2.1 The NVIDIA AI Foundation Models and Derivative Models must only be used or distributed for purposes that
are: permitted by this Agreement, consistent with the rights of others, and do not violate any applicable laws or
regulations.
2.2 You may not use the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models, Derivative Models or any output or results of them to
develop or improve any other large language model (excluding NVIDIA AI Foundation Models or Derivative
Models).
2.3 You may not change or remove copyright or other proprietary notices in the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models or
misrepresent the authorship of the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models, and you must cause any modified files to carry
prominent notices stating that you changed the files such that modifications are not misrepresented as an original
NVIDIA AI Foundation Models. Except as necessary to give attribution to works as described in this section, you
are not granted any trademark license under this Agreement.
2.4 You may not use the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models in any manner that would cause them to become subject
